//Today we're gonna learn about to merge the different branches to master branch 
//We'll do it from scratch 





//1: First we'll make new Branch in which we will do som work so that we can merge the data later
           //git checkout -b "newbranchname"


//2: after Working in the new branch we we got 1 master branch and one which we just created 

//3: now what if we want to merge the data of new branch into my master branch

//4: simply we'll go to our github and click on (Compare and pull request) which it already showing us when we push data in our new branch

//5: Then we'll Click on create pull request

//6: If there's no conflit then we're ready to push it in master branch :) 

//7: The most important step is to take the pull to get the latest changes as
// we're using 2 systems git our(local system) and github our(cloud system) so must take pull



// HERE WE GO!!!!!!! 
//OUR DATA IS MERGED SUCCESSFULLY!!
